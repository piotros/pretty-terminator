## Intro
> Easy to use Terminator terminal color schemes.

This project is just a Terminator related part extracted from [iTerm Color Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) repository.

All of schemes are concatenated into one file ready to paste into Terminator configuration.

**No need to add them one by one :wink:.**

## What's Included?
**Over 260 color schemes!** Take a look at [Schemes List :page_facing_up:](SchemesList.md).

## Installation Instructions
To make you Terminator prettier copy [PrettyTerminator.ini](PrettyTerminator.ini) content and paste it into `[profiles]` section of configuration file located in: `~/.config/terminator/config`.

Your configuration file should look like this:
```ini
[global_config]
  inactive_color_offset = 0.69
  title_hide_sizetext = True
  window_state = maximise
[keybindings]
[layouts]
  [[default]]
    [[[child1]]]
      parent = window0
      profile = default
      type = Terminal
    [[[window0]]]
      parent = ""
      type = Window
[plugins]
[profiles]
  [[default]]
    background_color = "#300a24"
    background_image = None
    font = Monospace 11
    foreground_color = "#ffffff"
    show_titlebar = False
    use_system_font = False
; Paste PrettyTerminator config here.
